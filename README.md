# Aviation Safety evaluation



### Project Overview:
This project aims to analyse data of accidents from 1962 to 2023 to identify what factors make aviation unsafe and identify business opportunities



### Business Problem

A clear understanding of aviation accidnets form the past 61 years will help identify critical gaps that exist in the business as well as the opportunities to expand into the sector.
I attempted to answer the following question using my data analysis 
### Business questions 
1. Which aircraft is associated with the most accidents 
2. During which phase of flight do most accidents occur? 
3. Does the number of engines correlate with accident and severity of accidents?
4. What weather conditions are associated with most accidents?


### The Data

In the `data` folder is a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses) from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.


### Data analysis
After uploading the data on jupyter noteboook, the following methods were employed 
1. Data processing:
this icluded cleaning, handiling misisng values and duplicates and also dropping unnecessary columns 
2. Data analysis using jupyter to explore trends and make general associations by make of aircraft, phase of flight, number of engines etc. 
3. visualisation: creating interactive charts and dashboards in Tablueau to support in stakeholder engagement
 

key findings include 
1. Cessna aircrafts are associated with most accidents 
2. Most accidents occure during landing and take off 
3. depending on visual cues in VMC as opposed to using instruments resulted in significantly more accidnets

Below is a dashboard of the finding

## Recommendations 
1. invest in larger aircrasfts with more engines as they are associated with fewer accidents 
2. Enhance training of pilots through refreshers and drills on areas such as take off and landing 
3. Invest and enforce use of technology especially for navigation by pilots

## Next steps
1. expand analysis to look at data sets from other regions 
2. conduct feasibility studies on best airports to launch business
